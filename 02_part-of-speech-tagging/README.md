## Part-of-speech (POS) tagging

There are two alternatives for part-of-speech tagging:
- [Morphosyntactic parser](https://github.com/cltl/morphosyntactic_parser_nl) is a wrapper around [Alpino](http://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/alp/Alpino/)).
- [ixa-pipe-pos](https://github.com/ixa-ehu/ixa-pipe-pos) is part of the IXA pipeline.
